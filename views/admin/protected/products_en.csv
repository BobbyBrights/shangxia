20338,DA TIAN DI <br> ROCKING CHAIR (WALNUT),"Tian Di encompasses heaven and earth. This collection of furniture is made of clean lines and soft arcs, generous and open in spirit, ready to contain both the heavens and the earth. The Da Tian Di rocking chair applies this clean design concept to traditional Ming furniture, bringing it up to date with modern living. Walnut has a smooth, bright grain, like a tracery of inlaid gold, gleaming in the rich, dark wood. The SHANG XIA craftsmen spent over a year discovering the best way to join braided leather to the walnut frame. Special craft techniques make the wood stronger and longer-lasting, providing gentle support to the whole body, and revealing the deep craft that goes into the making of the chair. The process of construction, from the handling of the walnut timber through to the joinery, polishing and the selection and braiding of the leather requires nearly five months for each chair.  Every step in the construction of a Da Tian Di rocking chair must be performed with the highest precision. The result is a perfectly balanced chair: the lightest of breezes will start a gentle rocking. Take a moment to gently rock your cares away leaving a person, you, living a moment of peace in your own free space between heaven and earth.",,en,2014-09-09 23:40:09,2014-09-22 21:37:29,,1,145,,product,3,20330,20316,,da-tian-di-rocking-chair-walnut-,http://http://sxhtml.local/./upload/288712a994410da19d4196949ed0fef3.jpg
20339,DA TIAN DI <br> ARMCHAIR (ZITAN),"Tian Di encompasses the heavens and the earth. This collection of furniture is made up of clean lines and soft arcs, generous and open in spirit, ready to contain the heavens and the earth. The Da Tian Di armchair is a light evolution of the traditional Ming ""official's hat chair"". It reverses the traditional Ming furniture concept of a rounded exterior and square centre and presents a square exterior and round interior. The result is a more modern line, revealing the deep craft that goes into its construction. SHANG XIA has ingeniously combined the simplicity and elegance of Ming furniture with the Western lounge concept, giving this new official's hat chair a soft seat and back, making it a more user-friendly experience. The Zitan is paired with high quality braided leather cushions. Tanners expertly slice whole cowhides into long strips, just 3.8mm wide. They are woven in a style similar to k'o-ssu silk tapestry, strip over strip, each piece entirely handmade, for a textured, living, breathing finish. The construction of each chair takes six to nine months with each step in the process being performed with needlepoint precision. The result is a finely crafted modern heirloom with a timeless appeal.",,en,2014-09-09 23:40:09,2014-09-22 21:37:29,,1,143,,product,3,20330,20316,,da-tian-di-armchair-zitan-,http://http://sxhtml.local/./upload/c40bd6024daa3c6f1d043b9e8000b046.jpg
20340,DA TIAN DI - DESK (ZITAN),"The SHANG XIA Da Tian Di collection draws inspiration from the rare and perfectly constructed Ming Dynasty “trestle desk”, to create an elegant and light desk in rich Zitan. As with all of the Da Tian Di collection, this desk is in the style of traditional Ming furniture, but it subverts the Ming concept of the round exterior/square centre to a square exterior and round interior. The result is a more modern line, revealing the deep craft that goes into its construction. The desk top is the same width as the supporting trestles, in the traditional frame-and-panel style, with a small seam between the frame and panel to allow the natural wood to breathe. This seam will subtly change with the humidity and climate, as if the desk were alive. The desk top rests lightly on the trestle supports which have drawers for stationery and documents. Zitan, precious and solid, has been polished by hand to a silken, glossy luster. Every step in the construction process must be performed with delicate precision. The process of construction, from the handling of the sandalwood timber through to the joinery and polishing, requires at least five months for every desk. The Da Tian Di desk should ideally be placed in front of a window. Pen and ink; fields and forests in front of you.

They may be used on a dresser, for jewellery, for cosmetics, for perfume, or as a pen case in the study. Skillfully interwoven the traditional sayagata pattern with the SHANGXIA logo to create a unique carved bamboo motif for the Twilight series. The bamboo carvers bring concentration and years of honed technique to their work. Using tools they make themselves, they split the bamboo into 0.5mm-thin strips, then cut 0.5mm-wide notches, and divide the strips into 5mm sections. Then, patiently and precisely, they piece together these sections, no larger than a grain of rice, into a composite image. A 10 square centimeters carving contains over 1,000 tiny sections, placed with such accuracy that the individual pieces become invisible and melt into an organic whole. As with traditional window screens, the design creates an airy and satisfying interplay of light and shade. Meanwhile, the form of these irregularly sized cases imitates the graceful lines of Ming Dynasty furniture; seen under the crystal twilight, a classical past seems to emerge once again.

Go was seen as a reflection of the Dao, and playing Go was considered as a path to greater understanding. The Wan Xiang collection is inspired by the universality of Go, and presents a Go set in warm-grained Rosewood and fine agate. The board borrows the clean lines of Ming Dynasty furniture. The fine grid of Go, representing the entire universe, is carved into a lovingly polished Rosewood block. The edges of the board and star points are inlaid in white brass. The two materials have been carefully selected and artfully combined by our craftsmen so that neither time nor changes in environment will break the bond between them. The precious wood and hard metal are locked together for eternity. The Go stones are presented in Rosewood bowls with agate lids. Each of the 360 stones is an agate droplet, specially selected by SHANG XIA for evenness of grain. Each stone is identical in size, smooth to the touch; placed on the board, they engage in their dance of yin and yang, illuminating and enlightening our world. Each Wan Xiang Go set takes a full three months to carve and polish to perfection. In Chinese legend, Go is known as the “forgetting game” - a player can forget his worries and even transcend this world.

SHANG XIA has revived an art form of the imperial house - filigree inlay. Gold threads and diamonds are inset into fine Zitan wood. The wood is polished, the design is scored in and then the gold filigree is carefully inlaid into the surface. These two contrasting materials seamlessly crafted together as if nature had formed them that way. The collision of textures creates an “other worldly” luminance. The passage of time is marked clearly in the grain of the wood giving the Essence series the weight of wisdom accumulated over years of life. Warmed by the neck of the wearer, Essence exudes a quiet, perfumed grace.",,en,2014-09-09 23:40:13,2014-09-22 21:37:30,,1,17,,product,2,20330,,,essence-1,http://http://sxhtml.local/./upload/In_Out_Essence_1.jpg
20365,LING LONG,"Inner painted snuff bottles were first created during the Qing Dynasty and are known as the “Sorcerer’s Art”. Combining calligraphy, painting and carving, they are concentrated expression of several traditional Chinese arts. The brilliance of their form inspired the SHANGXIA Ling Long collection. With curved bamboo brushes just 4mm wide, they paint the inner surfaces of each crystal. To achieve their delicate brushwork, they must often change brushes, threading them through the tiny opening. The artists work in reverse, constantly visualizing how their work will be seen face-on. Working with a curved brush through the tiny aperture requires intense concentration. The artists’ creation of landscapes and images inside the crystal pieces has been called sorcery. The Ling Long series can be used for display items or may be worn as a pendant that is refined and a little magical.",,en,2014-09-09 23:40:13,2014-09-22 21:37:29,,1,143,,product,2,20330,0,1,ling-long,http://http://sxhtml.local/./upload/b2fd46c5194cc7efa595c025e728968a.jpg

20701,Minstrel,"<p>
	The SHANG XIA peasant scarf collection is a full of gaiety and good humor. The scarves are inspired by contemporary folk painting from a rural area near Shanghai: the Jinshan rustic painting school. The brushwork is simple and clean, the colors bright and eye-catching, and the modern compositions have a raw, folk energy. SHANG XIA's work with the painters of Jinshan has allowed them to imaginatively evolve their use of materials, and to print this bright collection on silk and cashmere as commissioned by SHANG XIA.</p>
<p>
	The Minstrel collection is inspired by the painting The Entourage of Emperor Kangxi by the Qing Dynasty painter Wang Hui. It was commissioned specially for the opening of the SHANG XIA Space in Hongqiao Airport. The cloth is woven from high quality cashmere and silk, with a clear grain and a delicate feel. The colors are bold and vital. We hope this scarf will add a moment of joy to your travels, and a moment of escape to the most urban lifestyle. </p>

The moon is a constant theme in classical Chinese poetry. A dim, restful, expansive vision of moonlight saturates the imagination and the philosophy of many poets.

Like the bright, clear moon, they represent beauty and peace. The box is in three layers, each layer perfectly structured and functional.

20730,Twilight ,"The Twlight series is a set of wooden cases in rich Zitan wood, inlaid with delicate carved bamboo. They may be used on a dresser, for jewellery, for cosmetics, for perfume, or as a pen case in the study. Skillfully interwoven the traditional sayagata pattern with the SHANGXIA logo creates a unique carved bamboo motif for the Twlight series. The bamboo carvers bring concentration and years of honed technique to their work. Using tools they make themselves, they split the bamboo into 0.5mm-thin strips, then cut 0.5mm-wide notches, and divide the strips into 5mm sections. Then, patiently and precisely, they piece together these sections, no larger than a grain of rice, into a composite image. A 10 square centimeters carving contains over 1,000 tiny sections, placed with such accuracy that the individual pieces become invisible and melt into an organic whole. As with traditional window screens, the design creates an airy and satisfying interplay of light and shade. Meanwhile, the form of these irregularly sized cases imitates the graceful lines of Ming Dynasty furniture; seen under the crystal Twlight, a classical past seems to emerge once again. The poet Su Shi once wrote, ""Dancing in the half-light, you are far from this world."" Twlight exists in a space outside time.",,en,2014-09-18 11:49:07,2014-09-22 21:37:29,,1,89,,product,4,20331,,,twilight-,http://http://sxhtml.local/./upload/homeware/4.jpg
20731,Wu Fu ,"The SHANG XIA Wufu series draws on the Qing Dynasty flared vase form, but allows the vase to sleekly separate into a set of plates and containers. We blended two traditions, using lacquer to recreate the beauty of porcelain. This series uses a palette of five colors to echo the “Wufu”, each associated with one of the great porcelain kilns: Ru, Guan, Ge, Ding and Jun. The crackled porcelain effect on the outside of the vase was recreated using a painstaking technique of eggshell and lacquer. The eggshell is carefully cracked and pieced precisely back together. The pieces must be of uniform size, and must fit seamlessly together. Only the steadiest and most experienced lacquerworkers can do this delicate work. The gilded interior involves a slow finishing process, then the minute work of piecing gilt onto surface. It takes calmness and dedication to align the pieces seamlessly together. The color is infused into the lacquer, so the process of repeated polishing and burnishing brings it out in a warm gloss, understated and classic. The “Wufu” are: long life, prosperity, health, virtue and a peaceful passing. They represent a long life, well lived.",,en,2014-09-18 11:49:07,2014-09-22 21:37:29,,1,88,,product,4,20331,,,wu-fu-,http://http://sxhtml.local/./upload/homeware/5.jpg

This collection of furniture is made up of clean lines and soft arcs, generous and open in spirit, ready to contain the heavens and the earth.

The mobility and ease of adjustment mean that the screen can be used in any season; in winter, particularly, it can shape a warm oasis. The frame is designed on the principle of square exterior and rounded interior, with a coherent, simple form.
