						<h2>Silk-like Bamboo Strands</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>It was daybreak, the bamboo cutting Shifu (master) chopped his way to Cilao Mountain, a bamboo cutter hanging from his belt. The mountain and woods were shrouded in mist, his clothes soon became wet. The morning moisture was essential for the bamboo he was collecting, as when the sun came up the bamboo would turn hard and lose its flexibility.</p>
              <p>Ci Bamboo (sinocalamus affinis) is a plant that requires shade, and favors moist areas. As the bamboo has beautiful lush branches and leaves, local people describe it as “reaching for the sky, collecting water and energy”. According to the bamboo weaving Master Zhang who traveled with us, Ci bamboo grows in a water pit, in shade, away from the sun. Its shoots take only one year to grow into mature plants.  </p>

						<h2>Collecting the Bamboo</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>Shifu was collecting one-year-old bamboo plants. He walked in water, and investigated. With merely one glimpse, he could tell which bamboo made the best material. He studied the direction of the bamboo hair in order to judge which plants were bitter bamboo, and which were sweet. Only the bitter plants are suitable for making bamboo woven ware. “Tall and straight, with long joints, that makes the best material” said Master Zhang. Some of the bamboo plants are crooked, their lives are determined by changes in direction. Only the strong and upright are true bamboo plants that can bravely face what is presented to them in life. </p>
              <p>The cutters aimed carefully and cut the bamboo from the roots. Then they cut off the branches lengthways, and separated the bamboo into several segments using a hacksaw. Finally, they carried them down the mountain. This is usually a job for men. </p>

						<h2>Scraping the Cyan (Bamboo Skin)  </h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>The women had to sharpen their knives and be well prepared to scrape the cyan, they had to be quick. The colloid layer has to be scraped from the stalk before the moisture has left the bamboo. A second later, cyan colored fine hair floated from the bamboo, leaving a faint trace of sweet fragrance. </p>

						<h2>Separating <br/>the Bamboo</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>The first step was to separate bamboo into blocks, as quickly and as accurately as possible, when the bamboo was still fresh and tender. The bamboo stalk is split into equally thick segments and these in turn are split into strips. Taking a smooth strip in the palm of the left hand, holding the strip with the thumb and the index finger one centimeter away from the end, the cutter uses her right hand, a third of the way down the slice the cutter cuts into the bamboo, slicing toward herself. </p>
              <p>After hundreds of thousands of times of practice, a woman took two movements to complete the task. She cut a block, swung it up and down, then one bamboo slice fell off. She then cut again and swung, another slice off, and then another. All of the bamboo was sliced up in this way. Bamboo woven wares only require the first four layers of slices, sometimes only the first layer, since they have the best sheen.  </p>
              <p>Finally, the slices needed to be scraped again and again, until they were transparent, thinner than silk, less than 1mm.</p>

						<h2>Drying the Slice</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>The delicately thin slices were hung and dried in a ventilated place. When a breeze drifted through, all of the bluish green pieces floated up and down in the wind, like waves rolling on the water. Looking at the fluttering green, the women can breath a relaxed breathe., </p>

						<h2>Separating Strands</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>The dried slices were ready for their last step. In general, a 1 cm wide bamboo slice can be separated into 2 to 48 strands (width ranging from 0.15 mm to 0.5 mm). With the strands separated, we could proceed to weaving.</p>
              <p>Master Zhang spent over a decade studying bamboo woven wares. Well edified by natural landscapes and local cultures, he feels his bamboo cutting skills come from the traditions, environment and spirit of the land and its people. </p>
