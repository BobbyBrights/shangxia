								<h2>HAND SCULPTURE CLOTHING</h2>
								<div class="popcontxt">
                  <p>“Sculpture” series by SHANG XIA are clothes that are sculpted rather than sewn.
Most felt is made from wool, but SHANG XIA, together with Mongolian felt making craftswomen, have developed the technique of making cashmere felt. Each piece of work takes two skilled craftswomen over a week to complete.</p>
                  <p>The felt clothes were made, according to accurate designs, using the felt making technique once used to make yurts. Pressing, kneading, rubbing and twisting unceasingly, solid felt clothes were sculpted. Buttons were twisted and shaped, then pressed into the felt clothes, as if they had grown out of the garment. The same applied to the pockets. The seamless clothes are completed in one go so that there is coherence and unity in style. The cashmere felt clothes by SHANG XIA are each unique, and are like collectible works of art.</p>
                  <p>Kneading and rubbing, again and again, the felt makers do the job in a completely relaxed manner. To them, the process is as simple as zen.</p>
