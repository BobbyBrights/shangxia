						<h2>Choice of timber</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>Zitan is a very precious timber for two reasons. Firstly, the timber can only be used when it is several hundred years old, secondly, only 10% - 20% of the tree can be used to make furniture. Even to touch this rare wood is a matter of destiny! The carpenter prepared card models for each one of the furniture’s components, they were then cut from the timber according to the paper models. For example, a Ming style official hat chair has 42 components, including head rest, arm rest, back rest, apron, base pin and so on. It was said that in the Ming and Qing dynasties, all components for a piece of high quality hardwood furniture had to be from one single tree. Because of its rarity, the cutting craftsman shifu has to make the best, most efficient use of the timber.</p>

						<h2>Drying</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>Though separated and cut, wood still has life. Water in the furniture will cause it to split, become loose or even rot. All of the timber needs to be treated in order to ensure that it is fully dry. The wood needs to be soaked in “wax water” for at least 6 months before all the moisture is removed from the wood. The stable wax is used to replace the active water elements. The wood will then remain permanently dry.</p>
              <p>The biggest challenge to Chinese furniture carpenters has always been that solid wood expands and contracts with any slight change in temperature. Ancient carpenters invented the framing technique, a genius creation, however it did not tackle the problem completely. Master Gu spent more than 5 years inventing a technique exchanging water for wax within the wood, it is based on the heat exchange theory which ultimately prevents the wood from shrinking or distorting.</p>

						<h2>Construction</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
							<p>All Chinese furniture bases its construction on ancient architecture. The bridge, beam, post, pole and sparrow brace in architecture all have their equivalent within chair making, as the seat frame, edge, stretcher and brace are similar to elements in architecture.</p>
              <p>Metal nails are never used when connecting components, instead, mortise and tenons are used to fit legs and waists together in waisted furniture, and also together with stretchers. Ancient people used the expression “will not fall in eternity” to describe the strength of mortise and tenons. Mortise and tenons can endure pressure from several directions making the furniture as stable and enduring as Mount Tai. In ancient times, due to the technical limit of carpentry, mortise and tenons were difficult to make and joints came loose easily. Today, with the help of precise mechanisms,</p>
              <p>Master Gu has improved the accuracy of the joints by perfecting the quality of the mortise and tenons so that indeed they “will not fall in eternity”.</p>

						<h2>Carving</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>The carver placed various tools on the table. Zitan is famous for its hardness. If you hammer a nail into the timber, it will leave a mark and bend.</p>
              <p>Carving zitan requires several types of sharp knives. The carving master started from the top of the chair working his way down to the foot; from the skin of the timber he carved gradually inward, layer by layer much like a painter using knives as his brushes to create the image of the chair.</p>

						<h2>Polishing</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>“It is not smooth enough. Keep on polishing, keep on. “Master Gu demanded of his staff. It is worth the effort to polish the furniture as if one is creating a needle from an iron post.
In the zitan furniture craftsmen world the saying goes that zitan furniture is “10% shaping, 20% carving and 70% polishing ”. Originally, the wood grain was not used for the purpose of decoration. But now, the beautiful grain pattern has become the most crucial and characteristic feature of the Ming style furniture. It established a new aesthetic value for Chinese furniture. Traditionally, waxed cough grass and thin cotton cloth were used to polish the wood. Master Gu used an extremely fine water-sand paper to polish and draw out the natural and hidden patterns in the wood grain, until the surface was as shiny as fine silk.</p>
