              <p>The goats are combed by hand with an iron comb, in spring when the weather starts to become warmer. The cashmere is extremely soft and very compact, it is a perfect material for felt making. Pieces of plants and goat waste must then be removed from the combed fleece, the fleece is then stored in this state.</p>

						<h2>Selecting the cashmere</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>Selecting cashmere is one of the most important steps in felt making. The cashmere is selected according to different colors and qualities. The thinner and longer the fiber is, the better cashmere it is. SHANG XIA only chooses the finest cashmere for making its felt.</p>

						<h2>Combing</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>Based on the desired size and thickness of the garment required, the appropriate amount of cashmere is put aside. Nomadic people first put the cashmere fibers on a rotating wheel hammered full of densely packed needles. As one hand turns the wheel, with the other hand one continues to add cashmere fiber so that eventually the combed cashmere becomes light and fluffy. Slowly all of the puffy fibers start to stick together and by this time almost all of the impurities have been cleaned away. It begins to look like a small-sized piece of light, fluffy felt. Generally the nomadic people first make small-sized felts and then based on their needs, piece the small felts together into a larger sized felt.</p>

						<h2>ROLLING THE FELT</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>These small sized cloud-like pieces of felt are spread out and pieced together to create one larger sized piece of felt. If one wants to make a thicker garment, an additional layer of small sized felt pieces is added. The first layer is horizontally laid out and the second layer is vertically laid out. Lightly pressed together, just boiled hot water is sprinkled onto the cashmere as in a desert after the rain, immediately after the water soaks into the cashmere, soap is pressed into the mass. A thick hand towel is used to soak up the water till dry and then this mass is placed over a wrung wet towel and rolled up into the towel. Dipping the hands in soap, the roll is rolled back and forth for 40 minutes or until the felt has stuck together. The towel is opened and the four corners are pulled apart. The rolling process is repeated for about 3 hours and during this second time boiled water is sprinkled on the rolled towel, washing out the impurities and creating a durable piece of felt. When unrolled, the remaining edges are trimmed and cut off with a ruler. This is the most detailed and studied part of the process and a knife cannot be used. Lastly, hooks are used to open up flat the
fabric and untangle the tangled spots. The fabric is rinsed unhooked and hung up to dry. Thus a piece of felt is created.</p>

						<h2>CREATING CLOTHING</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>The ready-made felt is laid on a table to dry. The clothing paper pattern is then laid on top of the fabric. The felt is sprinkled with boiling water, and dipping the hands in baby soap, pressed, rubbed and kneaded until it takes shape, constantly comparing the garment in process to the paper pattern. The garment slowly takes shape. It is then hung on a mannequin where further shaping and molding takes place so that the garment is fitted to every detail of the human form. Towels are then used to daub up the excess water. The garment is naturally air dried.</p>

						<h2>SHRINKING THE CLOTHING</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>At the final step, the garment is boiled in water to set the shape. As there is a certain amount of shrinkage in this process, the ultimate desired size of the garment depends on the skill, and experience of the felt worker in controlling the temperature and length of time the garment is boiled.</p>
