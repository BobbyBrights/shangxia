  In September 2013, SHANG XIA came to Paris, city of art and culture. The first overseas SHANG XIA space was unveiled at 8 rue de Sèvres, on the left bank of the Seine, and simultaneously launched a two-week exhibition of Chinese contemporary crafts. SHANG XIA presented and shared with the world the pleasures and sensibility of Chinese craftsmanship and oriental elegance. The exhibition finished on September 26.</p>

  The exhibition was held in an old building with high ceilings in Saint Germain. The entire space was designed by architect Kengo Kuma and SHANG XIA artistic director Jiang Qiong Er around the theme of bamboo. Engaging all five senses, SHANG XIA used shape, sound, color, aroma and texture to create an airy but satisfying interplay of light and shade. Bamboo screens guided visitors through a sinuous tea space, incense space and craft demonstration. Bamboo trees constructed of bamboo slips loomed like living sculptures, suspending the space between daylight and the shade of the bamboo grove. Here visitors could experience a lifestyle that balances heaven and earth, inside and outside, man and nature and the lavish and the plain.</p>

  SHANG XIA Paris boutique is located at 8 Rue de Sèvres, Paris, designed by celebrated architect Kengo Kuma, who utilized a combination of rhythms and principals of art inspired by historic Paris.</p>

  The architecture of the SHANG XIA Paris boutique is designed as a cloud-like space made of thin ceramic panels. Historically, ceramic has been a crucial element that forms Chinese culture. Chinese ceramic had also long been an object of admiration in Europe. Six thousand thin ceramic panels are suspended from the ceiling to cover the entire space. The glossy white face, unique to ceramic, created a lighting state you might find in the pointillism paintings of the impressionistic art age.</p>
