              <p>“The Book of Jingdezhen Pottery” describes the pottery workshop in the 17th century, “Ceramics are made in kilns. Kilns belong to different families. Workers associate with their workshops. Workshops have masters. Division of work in ceramic production is fine.” </p>
							<p>Song Yingxing, a scientist in the Ming Dynasty, wrote in his book “Works of Science” that “one clay needs to pass through 72 pairs of hands before it is finally finished.” </p>
              <p>Today, in Master Lu’s eggshell porcelain workshop, the centuries long tradition is preserved. One worker takes charge of one process only. </p>

              <p>Porcelain stones and Kaolin clay mixed and crushed together in the muller. Though machinery has been introduced, the process is still the same as it always has been “at an even speed the muller stones grind together, so ingredients get well crushed and ground into a powder“. Master Lu is the only one who knows the proportion of each ingredient, water and muller stones. </p>

						<h2>Construction</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>The well mixed ingredients were kneaded into a paste, under the hands of the craftsman, the clay is worked into the shape of a bowl. Turning the clay mixture is the first step of molding. According to the craftsman, “turning is all about how you apply pressure. You have to be stable and even to keep air out of the clay mixture, a bubble destroys everything. You want your bowl to be round, you have to be hard and firm, otherwise it becomes out of shape.” The technique and feel for the clay is not something one can learn in one or two years.</p>

						<h2>Paring and Trimming</h2>
						<div class="popcontxt">
              <p>After turning, the thickness of the bowls wall was about 2-3 mm. Eggshell porcelain needs to be pared and fine trimmed using a knife at least one hundred times to achieve a fine 0.4 mm thickness as thin as eggshell and as thin as the cicada’s wing. </p>
              <p>The paring craftsman, Lei, is a quiet man. Knife in hand, he focused on the bowl. Eggshell is extremely fragile and can easily be pierced if one tiny mistake is made. ”I rely on my experience, sometimes on instinct too,” said Lei. The inner and outer walls must be equally thin and smooth. </p>
              <p>Fine trimming requires an even more precise execution. Each cut is a test for the executor. One has to have no distracting thought in mind, so that the beginning and end of every cut is identical, as sharp as the last. ”Too hard a breath will cause a hand movement too big, destroying your work. Trimming men often say ‘success depends on every cut and every breath.’ It is quite true. They trim the wares, and they cultivate their minds, searching for peace and stability from within,” Master Lu pointed out.</p>

						<h2>Glazing</h2>

              <p>Glazing is the most crucial part in the whole process, and was performed by Master Lu himself. The varying viscosities of glazes create different final outcomes. The glaze has to be even on all parts of the body, the same thickness throughout. Seemingly easy, glazing is actually the most difficult part.</p>
