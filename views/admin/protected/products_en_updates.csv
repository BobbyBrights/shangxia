20341,DA TIAN DI <br/> DESK (ZITAN),"The SHANG XIA Da Tian Di collection draws inspiration from the rare and perfectly constructed Ming Dynasty “trestle desk”, to create an elegant and light desk in rich Zitan. As with all of the Da Tian Di collection, this desk is in the style of traditional Ming furniture, but it subverts the Ming concept of the round exterior/square centre to a square exterior and round interior. The result is a more modern line, revealing the deep craft that goes into its construction. The desk top is the same width as the supporting trestles, in the traditional frame-and-panel style, with a small seam between the frame and panel to allow the natural wood to breathe. This seam will subtly change with the humidity and climate, as if the desk were alive. The desk top rests lightly on the trestle supports which have drawers for stationery and documents. Zitan, precious and solid, has been polished by hand to a silken, glossy luster. Every step in the construction process must be performed with delicate precision. The process of construction, from the handling of the sandalwood timber through to the joinery and polishing, requires at least five months for every desk. The Da Tian Di desk should ideally be placed in front of a window. Pen and ink; fields and forests in front of you. Nature inspires; the images flow from your brush.",,en,2014-09-09 23:40:10,2014-09-22 21:37:29,,1,146,,product,3,20330,20316,1,da-tian-di-desk-zitan-,http://http://sxhtml.local/./upload/a09dd1a150779d725fbb548beee99a64.jpg

20392,BLOSSOM,"The Mongolian cashmere is hand pulled in Nepal and then hand woven into fabric. A traditional wooden loom is worked by hand, each warp thread is inserted into the loom, one by one. 

As it is hand woven, each fabric is unique and integrates natural inclusions into the fabric. The work is delicate and very time consuming and hence production is limited. The loom worker manually changes the direction of the thread hence creating wave like pleats in the upper garment, leaving the lower garment untouched - the garment opens up much like a flower bloom.

20365,LING LONG,"Inner painted snuff bottles were first created during the Qing Dynasty and are known as the “Sorcerer’s Art”. Combining calligraphy, painting and carving, they are concentrated expression of several traditional Chinese arts. The brilliance of their form inspired the SHANGXIA Ling Long collection. With curved bamboo brushes just 4mm wide, they paint the inner surfaces of each crystal. To achieve their delicate brushwork, they must often change brushes, threading them through the tiny opening. The artists work in reverse, constantly visualizing how their work will be seen face-on. Working with a curved brush through the tiny aperture requires intense concentration. The artists’ creation of landscapes and images inside the crystal pieces has been called sorcery. The Ling Long series can be used for display items or may be worn as a pendant that is refined and a little magical.",,en,2014-09-09 23:40:13,2014-09-22 21:37:29,,1,143,,product,2,20330,0,1,ling-long,http://http://sxhtml.local/./upload/b2fd46c5194cc7efa595c025e728968a.jpg
